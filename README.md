# Deterministic-Li-Rinzel-Model-Simulation
The code simulates calcium dynamics using the Li-Rinzel model and optimizes parameters v2 and v3 via gradient descent on data segments to minimize RMSE. This segment-wise approach captures time-based changes, improving fit and realism between simulated and experimental calcium data.
